professional, and are easy to read. Use the

Name: Michael Gallagher

Cal Poly Email: msgallag@calpoly.edu

Lab Status: I think it is completely done?

Comlpilation and execution: Use "make" in the command prompt. Then use "./piku"

Questions: What am I supposed to do and turn in?

Issues: It's been forever since I did assembly, I only touched on the RAT assembler. Cal Poly's VPN service is not thebest so I am going to use my own RP. I only just joined the class so I was behind on lecture.
